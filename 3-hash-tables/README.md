# CS 271 Project 3 â€“ Hash Tables

Authors: Namu Lee Kim, Huy Phan, Andrew McCutchan

Language: C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements and tests multiple custom hash table data structures in C++, including:

- Hash Map (with separate chaining)
- Hash Map using a Red-Black Tree backend
- Set (built from scratch using vectors)
- Custom Hash Functions
- Doubly Linked List (used for chaining)

The goal was to understand the internal mechanics of hash tables and evaluate runtime and distribution performance through empirical testing.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `DoublyLinkedList.*` â€“ Doubly linked list class used for chaining
- `HashFunction.*` â€“ Custom hash function implementation
- `HashMap.*` â€“ Core hash map class using chaining
- `HashMapTree.*` â€“ Hash map using Red-Black Tree for chaining
- `RBTree.*`, `RBTreeNode.*` â€“ Red-Black Tree implementation
- `Set.*` â€“ Custom set class built using vectors
- `customexceptions.hpp` â€“ Custom exception handling for hash operations
- `mytests.cpp` â€“ All test cases and performance benchmarking
- `Makefile` â€“ Build configuration for the project

---

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions

- Avoided using the C++ STL set to deepen understanding; opted for a vector-backed implementation instead
- Focused performance analysis on `HashMap` due to time constraints, with limited testing on `Set`
- Built modular components to support flexible testing and substitution of data structures

---

## ðŸ“Š Observations

- `HashMap` generally outperformed `Set`, though results may reflect implementation differences more than inherent structural advantages
- For `HashMap`, search operations took the longest; for `Set`, insertion was the slowest, likely due to input scale
- Hash function distribution was visually acceptable, showing consistent value spread across varying input sizes
