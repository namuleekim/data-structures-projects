# CS-271 Projects â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)

This repository contains a series of C++ programming projects completed as part of **CS-271: Data Structures** at Denison University. The course emphasized core data structures, algorithm design, and command-line based problem-solving with increasing complexity.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each folder represents a themed module or milestone project:

- `0-linked-lists/`  
  Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

- `1-sorting-algorithms/`  
  Implemented and benchmarked classic sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

- `2-hash-maps-trees/`  
  Built basic hash table and tree structures (unbalanced BSTs) to practice collision handling and recursive logic.

- `4-bst-rbt/`  
  Designed and tested Binary Search Trees and Red-Black Trees, with a focus on balancing and traversal efficiency.

- `5-graphs/`  
  Introduced adjacency lists and matrices, and implemented depth-first and breadth-first traversal on directed graphs.

- `6-final-proj-dijkstras-cli-program/`  
  Final project: Developed a CLI-based application to simulate real-world pathfinding using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm on user-defined graph data.
